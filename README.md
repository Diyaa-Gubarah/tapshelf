# Tabshelf - React TypeScript Project

Tabshelf is a React TypeScript project for managing inventory.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

#### Best Practices

In this project, I adhere to several best practices for building React applications:

- Custom Components: I utilize custom components such as Box, Text, Input, and Button to maintain consistency and reusability throughout the application.

- Styled Components: I use styled-components library for styling my components. This allows us to write CSS directly within my JavaScript/TypeScript files, keeping styles scoped to the component and improving maintainability.

- Hooks: I make extensive use of React hooks, such as useState, useEffect, etc., to manage state and side effects within my components.

- Custom Hooks: I implement custom hooks, such as useModal, to encapsulate logic and share it between components, promoting code reusability and organization.

- Composition: I practice composition over inheritance to create complex UI components by combining simpler components together.

- State Management with Zustand: I use Zustand as my state management library to manage global state in a simple and efficient way. Zustand provides a lightweight and easy-to-use solution for managing state in React applications.

- Consistent Naming Conventions: I use a consistent naming convention for variables, functions, and components. This makes it easier to understand my code by giving meaningful names to different parts.
